Predict the Introverts from the Extroverts Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 7
## Dataset Description

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Extrovert vs. Introvert Behavior dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

**Note:** This is a relatively small dataset, so it is ideal for comparing different modeling approaches, making visualizations, and exploring analysis techniques.
